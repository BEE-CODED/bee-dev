# Bee

Spec-driven development workflow plugin for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

Bee takes a feature idea through a complete, repeatable pipeline: **spec > plan > execute > review > test > commit**. Every step is orchestrated by Claude Code with review gates between phases. Includes a comprehensive code audit system for analyzing inherited/vibecoded projects, debug & recovery intelligence, fully autonomous pipeline orchestration, and the **Bee Hive live dashboard** — a local web UI for browsing phases, reports, notes, seeds, and workflow state in a readable IDE-style interface.

## Install

```bash
# Add the repo as a marketplace source
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/BEE-CODED/bee-dev

# Install the plugin
claude plugin install bee
```

**Option 2: Local path (for development)**

```bash
# Use --plugin-dir flag pointing to the plugin inside the repo

## Supported Stacks (10)

- `laravel-inertia-vue` (gold standard -- 3 stack-specific agents)
- `laravel-inertia-react`
- `nestjs`
- `vue`
- `nextjs`
- `react`
- `angular`
- `react-native-expo`
- `kmp-compose`
- `claude-code-plugin`

Stack detection is automatic during `/bee:init` based on `package.json`, `composer.json`, and `build.gradle.kts`.

## Project Structure

After running `/bee:init`, your project gets a `.bee/` directory:

```
your-project/
+-- .bee/
    +-- config.json          # Stack, linter, test runner, CI config
    +-- PROJECT.md           # Codebase index (structure, entry points, deps)
    +-- CONTEXT.md           # Extracted codebase patterns (from context-builder)
    +-- STATE.md             # Current workflow state (phases, progress, decisions)
    +-- user.md              # User preferences and work style rules
    +-- COMPACT-CONTEXT.md   # Context snapshot for /bee:compact
    +-- AUDIT-REPORT.md      # Latest audit report (from /bee:audit)
    +-- audit-findings.json  # Machine-readable findings (for /bee:audit-to-spec)
    +-- specs/               # Feature specs
    +-- audit-specs/         # Spec descriptions generated from audit findings
    +-- quick/               # Persisted quick task plans
    +-- reviews/             # Review reports from /bee:review-implementation
    +-- eod-reports/         # End-of-day audit reports
    +-- seeds/               # Deferred ideas with trigger conditions
    +-- debug/               # Debug sessions (state.json + report.md)
    +-- metrics/             # Phase metrics and health history
    +-- forensics/           # Forensic reports
    +-- discussions/         # Discussion notes from /bee:discuss
    +-- notes/               # Quick notes from /bee:note
    +-- threads/             # Cross-session knowledge
    +-- false-positives.md   # Review findings marked as false positives
    +-- LEARNINGS.md         # Phase learnings for implementer adjustments
```

## How It Works

1. **Spec creation** (`/bee:new-spec`) -- Structured developer interview (adaptive rounds): researches codebase first, then converges on requirements and writes spec + phases.

2. **Phase planning** (`/bee:plan-phase`) -- Decomposes a phase into tasks, runs research, assigns to parallel waves. Auto-reviews plan with 4 agents before proceeding.

3. **Execution** (`/bee:execute-phase`) -- Spawns implementer agents per wave. Each follows TDD: write tests first, then implement, then verify. Post-wave validation runs full suite + linter + static analysis once. Adaptive error recovery classifies failures and retries intelligently.

4. **Review** (`/bee:review`) -- 4 specialized agents review in parallel (bug-detector, pattern-reviewer, plan-compliance-reviewer, stack-reviewer), findings validated with specialist escalation, auto-fixed, optionally re-reviewed.

5. **Testing** (`/bee:test`) -- Generates manual test scenarios, presents for verification, routes failures to fixer agent.

6. **Commit** (`/bee:commit`) -- Shows diff summary, suggests conventional commit message, waits for confirmation.

7. **Audit** (`/bee:audit`) -- 10 specialized agents scan the entire codebase in parallel (security, errors, database, architecture, API, frontend, performance, testing, end-to-end flows, dependencies). Findings validated to filter hallucinations. Report generated with severity grouping.

8. **Debug** (`/bee:debug`) -- Hypothesis-driven investigation with 3-7 dynamic hypotheses, auto-pruning, session persistence, pattern library for cross-session learning.

9. **Forensics** (`/bee:forensics`) -- Read-only workflow diagnostics with 4-factor severity escalation, cross-phase dependency tracing, rollback path generation, and handoff to debug.

## Implementation Modes

Three modes control cost and speed via model selection:

| Mode | Scanning agents | Critical agents |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Economy** | sonnet | sonnet |
| **Quality** (default) | sonnet | opus |
| **Premium** | opus | opus |

Set via `config.implementation_mode` in `.bee/config.json`.

## Hooks (8 events, 27 validators)

- **SessionStart** -- Load project context + configure honeycomb statusline
- **PostToolUse** -- Auto-lint after file edits
- **PreToolUse** -- Pre-commit validation gate (linter + tests)
- **PreCompact** -- Save session context before compression
- **SubagentStart** -- Inject user preferences into subagent context (covers all 39 agents including stack-specific variants)
- **SubagentStop** -- 27 role-specific output validators (TDD compliance, verification evidence, finding format, read-only enforcement)
- **Stop** -- Warn about unreviewed phases
- **SessionEnd** -- Session metrics summary

## Statusline

```
Opus bee 4.0 | hexhexhex P2/5 EXEC | gauge 40% | d3
```

Shows: model + bee version | honeycomb phase progress + status | context gauge | git dirty.

## Bee Hive Dashboard

A local web dashboard for browsing your `.bee/` workflow state in a readable IDE-style interface. Perfect for reading phase plans, reviewing generated reports, or navigating notes and seeds without cat/less gymnastics in the terminal.

```
/bee:hive          # Start the server and open the browser (default: http://localhost:3333)
/bee:hive stop     # Stop the server
```

**What you get:**

- **3-column IDE layout** — Left sidebar file tree, main content area with tabs, right sidebar live activity feed. Both sidebars collapsible via header toggles.
- **File tree navigation** — Browse phases, notes, seeds, quick tasks, discussions, forensics, debug sessions, and archived specs. Section counts + status badges per entry.
- **Tab system with markdown viewer** — Click any file to open it in a tab. Markdown rendered with hive-themed headings, code blocks, tables, and links. JSON/YAML files shown as plain text. Overview tab is pinned and always accessible.
- **Phase detail view** — Click a phase to see a rich view with workflow progress chain (plan → review → execute → test → commit), description, goal, deliverables, success criteria, requirements, and dependencies — cross-referenced from `state.phases` + `spec.phases` + `roadmap.phaseMapping`.
- **Roadmap timeline** — Header button opens a roadmap tab with a vertical phase timeline. Click any phase card to jump to its detail view.
- **Split pane** — Click the split button on any tab to pop it into a second column for side-by-side viewing (e.g., compare a phase's PLAN.md and REVIEW.md).
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — `[`/`]` for prev/next tab, `\` to toggle split, `Escape` to close split or active tab. All gated on "no input focused" so typing into search boxes is safe.
- **Persistent state** — Open tabs, active tab, sidebar collapse state, and expanded sections all persist across reloads via localStorage.
- **Live snapshot polling** — Activity feed detects new files, phase status changes, and metric updates every 5 seconds with graceful degradation on network errors.
- **Config editing** — The Config panel in the Overview has inline toggles for `review.against_spec`, `review.against_standards`, `review.dead_code`, `ship.final_review`, `ship.max_review_iterations`, and `implementation_mode`. Changes POST to `/api/config` and persist to `.bee/config.json`.

**When to use it:**

- Reading long phase plans (TASKS.md, PLAN.md) or review reports (REVIEW.md) — much nicer than terminal
- Browsing the seed backlog or note collection without scrolling through directories
- Showing a colleague "what did Bee do for this feature" without SSH-ing into the repo
- Inspecting the roadmap and phase status at a glance
- Comparing files side-by-side via split pane

**When to skip it:**

- Single-file edits or quick grep tasks — the terminal is faster
- Running Bee commands — always done via the Claude Code CLI, not the dashboard
- When you're in a `/bee:autonomous` or `/bee:ship` flow and don't need the distraction

The server is a zero-dependency Node.js HTTP server under `plugins/bee/scripts/hive-server.js`. It binds `127.0.0.1` only (no remote exposure) and shuts down automatically when the Claude Code session that started it exits (owner PID monitoring).

## Scoped Testing

Parallel implementer agents run ONLY their task-specific tests. The conductor validates the full suite, linter, and static analysis once per wave after all agents complete. This eliminates resource contention and reduces wave execution time by ~70%.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI installed
- A supported project stack (or manual configuration)
