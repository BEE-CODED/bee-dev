All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [4.1.0] - 2026-04-17 -- Vendor Citation Contract (Anti-Hallucination Guard)

### Added
- **Vendor citation contract across the review + audit pipeline** — every shipped finding from any of 24 reviewer/auditor agents must classify Evidence Strength as `[CITED]` (codebase trace, self-evidencing) or `[VERIFIED]` (vendor docs / OWASP / RFC / MDN / Context7-fetched), and provide a Citation pointer. Pure-`[ASSUMED]` findings are dropped, NOT shipped. Mirrors and extends the existing `agents/researcher.md:122-128` tag system precedent.
- **New schema fields** in `skills/core/templates/review-report.md`: `Evidence Strength: [CITED] | [VERIFIED]` and `Citation: <URL | Context7 lib ID + query | skill section path | codebase file:line>`. Slotted between existing `Evidence:` and `Impact:` fields. Total finding template now 13 fields (was 11).
- **`[CITED]` vs `[VERIFIED]` distinction** — empirical findings (codebase file:line trace) qualify as `[CITED]` even without external vendor docs; the trace IS the citation. Normative findings (best-practice claims) require `[VERIFIED]` external source. Avoids misclassifying legitimate empirical findings as STYLISTIC just because they lack vendor docs.
- **`DROPPED` verdict** in `finding-validator` and `audit-finding-validator` — distinct from `FALSE POSITIVE`. `DROPPED` means the reviewer made a process error (missing/`[ASSUMED]`/malformed citation); the underlying code claim was NOT evaluated. `quick.md` and `review.md` skip persistence of `DROPPED` to `.bee/false-positives.md` to avoid polluting the FP store and risking suppression of legitimate future findings via summary match.
- **`Evidence Requirement (Drop Policy)` sections** in `skills/review/SKILL.md` and `skills/audit/SKILL.md` documenting the contract, the empirical/normative split, the drop policy, and the distinction from researcher's permissive `[ASSUMED]` rules.
- **NEW test file** `plugins/bee/scripts/tests/vendor-citation-contract.test.js` — 166 structural assertions pinning the contract across all 24 agents + 3 schema files + 3 commands. Negative + positive checks ensure regression would fail CI.

### Changed
- 24 reviewer/auditor agent prompts updated with the contract (3 tiers: 5 with Context7 + full vendor lookup, 17 without Context7 + direct vendor URL citation, 2 validators with format-only fabrication checks + drop logic). Output formats extended with the 2 new fields per each agent's variant.
- 3 commands (`quick.md`, `review-implementation.md`, `review.md`) — inline finding-format lists extended from 10 to 13 fields.
- Plugin version: 4.0.7 -> 4.1.0
- Marketplace version: 1.4.3 -> 1.5.0

### Discussion
`.bee/discussions/2026-04-17-vendor-citation-reviews.md` captures the design rationale, the empirical/normative split decision, and the colleague's anti-hallucination motivation that drove the strict drop policy.

## [4.0.7] - 2026-04-17 -- Ceremony Bump Removal (Downstream Safety Hotfix)

### Fixed
- **`/bee:complete-spec` and `/bee:archive-spec` were silently corrupting the plugin install cache** for every downstream user. Both commands had a "Bump plugin version" step that tried `plugins/bee/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` first, then fell back to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — which resolves to `~/.claude/plugins/cache/bee-dev/bee/X.Y.Z/`. When a user ran the ceremony in their own project, the relative path missed, the fallback hit the cache, and the bump silently mutated the installed plugin. The drift warning then told the user to run `/plugin` reinstall — which would clobber the bump. Net result: silent install corruption + a misleading warning + a meaningless bump (downstream users don't author the bee plugin and their bumps would be erased on next marketplace install anyway).

### Removed
- **The "Bump plugin version" step is removed entirely from both ceremonies.** The plugin author's bump is a 1-user concern — burying a no-op step in user-facing flow is poor UX. Bee plugin versions are now managed manually by the plugin author (or via a future dedicated `/bee:release` command if it becomes annoying). `/bee:archive-spec` is now strictly about archiving; `/bee:complete-spec` is strictly about audit + changelog + tag + archive + history + state-reset.
- `archive-spec.md`: removed Step 6 entirely; Step 7 (Summary) renumbered to Step 6; dropped "Plugin version" line from summary; updated intro and design notes.
- `complete-spec.md`: removed "Bump plugin version" sub-block from Step 8 (including the cache drift warning); dropped "Plugin version" line from Step 9 summary; updated intro.

### Added
- **Negative-assertion regression contract.** Both `complete-spec-command.test.js` and `archive-spec-command.test.js` now contain assertions pinning that the ceremony command does NOT contain a "Bump plugin version" step, does NOT instruct writing to `plugin.json`, does NOT increment `PATCH`, and does NOT reference `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` as a write fallback. A future regression that re-adds the bump (in any form) will fail CI.

### Changed
- Plugin version: 4.0.6 -> 4.0.7
- Marketplace version: 1.4.2 -> 1.4.3

## [4.0.6] - 2026-04-17 -- Hive Dashboard Empty Snapshot Fix

### Fixed
- **`/bee:hive` dashboard rendered empty for every user** — `scripts/hive-start.sh:99` was forwarding only `HIVE_OWNER_PID` to the spawned `node hive-server.js` child. `resolveBeeDir()` then walked up from `__dirname` (the plugin cache path, e.g. `~/.claude/plugins/cache/bee-dev/bee/4.0.5/scripts/`), found no `.bee/` ancestor, returned `null`, and the snapshot/config/file handlers were never wired. `/api/snapshot` stayed on the stub handler that returns only `{"timestamp":"..."}`. Fix adds `HIVE_BEE_DIR="$BEE_DIR"` to the `nohup env ...` prefix on the same line — `BEE_DIR` is unconditionally validated by the discovery block earlier in the script.

### Added
- **New integration test** (`plugins/bee/scripts/tests/hive-start-integration.test.js`) — spawns `hive-start.sh` as a real subprocess against a temp `.bee/` fixture and asserts the snapshot reflects a sentinel spec name written to a temp `STATE.md`. The sentinel is load-bearing: a simple `state !== undefined` assertion would pass even with the bug because `__dirname` walk-up finds the bee repo's own `.bee/` in the dev environment. Closes the test gap that let this bug ship — existing unit tests bypass the shell launcher by setting `process.env` directly.
- **Structural Test 15 in `hive-start.test.js`** — pins `HIVE_BEE_DIR="$BEE_DIR"` on the `nohup env ... node` line with a right-anchored negative lookahead `(?![A-Z_0-9])` to reject prefix-matched neighbors like `$BEE_DIR_OTHER`.

### Changed
- Plugin version: 4.0.5 -> 4.0.6
- Marketplace version: 1.4.1 -> 1.4.2

## [4.0.5] - 2026-04-12 -- TDD Applicability Guard

### Changed
- **TDD cycle now skips infrastructure code** — migrations, seeders, factory definitions, config files, route registration, middleware registration, and simple models with no business logic are no longer force-tested. TDD applies only to code with branching logic (controllers, services, policies, form requests, components, hooks, API endpoints). Mixed tasks test only the business logic parts.
- Updated `skills/standards/testing/SKILL.md` with "What NOT to Test" section listing infrastructure anti-patterns
- Updated `agents/implementer.md` with Step 2.6 TDD Applicability Check (evaluate before entering RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- Updated `agents/quick-implementer.md` with same Step 2.6 mirrored
- Updated `agents/stacks/laravel-inertia-vue/implementer.md` with Laravel-specific Step 2.6 (Eloquent `$fillable`/`$casts`, `match` expressions, observers, jobs, notifications)
- Plugin version: 4.0.4 -> 4.0.5

## [4.0.0] - 2026-04-09 -- Bee Sentinel: Debug & Recovery Intelligence + Skills Expansion + Command Quality Overhaul

### Added
- **Forensics command** (`/bee:forensics`) -- Read-only workflow diagnostics with 4-factor severity escalation (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), 5-step cross-phase dependency tracing, rollback path generation (1-3 paths, safest-to-aggressive ordering), and forensics-to-debug handoff

- **Health intelligence** (`/bee:health`) -- 13 checks (up from 9): added workflow health, code quality trends, productivity metrics, forensic cross-reference. Historical baselining in health-history.json with per-check mode after 5 entries. 3+ consecutive degradation trend detection.
- **Error recovery** in `/bee:execute-phase` -- Failure classification (transient/persistent/architectural), cascading failure detection for Wave 2+ tasks, adaptive retry budgets (unlimited+backoff for transient, 3-attempt for persistent, 1+escalate for architectural), `$RECLASSIFIED_PERSISTENT` flag prevents classification loops
- **Cross-system bridges** -- Forensics-to-debug handoff with pre-populated symptoms, debug pattern library extraction on resolution, forensic cross-reference in health checks
- **Bee Mastery Guide** (`skills/guide/SKILL.md`) -- 205-line workflow intelligence skill with 6 sections: decision tree (spec + phase + multi-phase), command reference by intent (49 commands in 9 groups), smart feature suggestions (IF-THEN proactive rules), 13 anti-patterns, ecosystem model, self-referencing triggers. Dual delivery: compact excerpt at SessionStart + full guide on-demand.
- **Honeycomb statusline** -- New design with `bee` emoji, `hex` hexagons for phase progress, heavy-line context gauge, thin dotted separators
- **Scoped testing for parallel agents** -- Agents run ONLY their task-specific tests; conductor validates full suite + linter + static analysis once per wave (~70% time reduction)
- **Verification evidence** in SubagentStop hooks -- Implementer and quick-implementer agents must include actual test runner output, not just count claims
- **Context isolation docs** in core skill -- Defines what each agent type receives vs must NOT receive, with exceptions for retries and cascading failures

- **7 new agents**: debug-investigator, dependency-auditor, assumptions-analyzer, integration-checker, swarm-consolidator, ui-auditor, testing-auditor
- **Post-wave full validation** (Step 5d.0 in execute-phase) -- Runs full test suite, linter, and static analysis ONCE per wave after all agents complete
- **Model escalation** in execute-phase -- Sonnet agents escalated to opus after 3 failures
- **18 new conditional library/standards skills** -- prisma, drizzle, tailwind-v4, tanstack-query, supabase, stripe, zustand, trpc, shadcn-vue, sentry, storybook, email, s3-storage, auth-patterns, realtime, ci-cd, docker, monorepo, i18n. All load conditionally based on package.json/config detection.
- **Firm rules R8 + R9** -- R8: no completion claims without evidence (paste actual test output). R9: HIGH confidence only for review findings (exact file:line, traceable impact, 5-15 per phase).
- **Async testing patterns** in standards/testing -- promises, timers, waitFor, error rejection, PHP queue fakes, flaky test prevention
- **Severity calibration table** in audit skill -- 7 borderline examples with "3 AM test" heuristic
- **Version-aware queries + result disambiguation** in context7 skill

## [3.1.0] - 2026-03-17 -- Audit System & Quality Expansion

### Added
- **Comprehensive code audit system** — `/bee:audit` command orchestrates 9 specialized audit agents in parallel, validates findings to filter hallucinations, and generates a structured report
- **Audit-to-spec bridge** — `/bee:audit-to-spec` converts confirmed audit findings into actionable specs grouped by severity (CRITICAL → individual specs, HIGH → grouped, MEDIUM → cleanup, LOW → consolidated)
- **9 specialized audit agents**: security-auditor (SEC), error-handling-auditor (ERR), database-auditor (DB), architecture-auditor (ARCH), api-auditor (API), frontend-auditor (FE), performance-auditor (PERF), testing-auditor (TEST), audit-bug-detector (BUG)
- **Finding validator** — audit-finding-validator reads actual code to classify findings as CONFIRMED / FALSE POSITIVE / NEEDS CONTEXT, eliminating hallucinations
- **Report generator** — audit-report-generator merges validated findings into `AUDIT-REPORT.md` (human-readable) and `audit-findings.json` (machine-readable for audit-to-spec)
- **Audit skill** — `skills/audit/SKILL.md` defines severity levels, finding format with agent prefixes, validation rules, report template, and spec generation rules
- **11 SubagentStop validators** for all audit agents — enforce finding format, read-only compliance, and summary section presence
- **Context7 integration docs** in `core/SKILL.md` — centralized how-to, when-to-use, fallback behavior, multi-stack usage
- **Comprehensive error recovery** in `/bee:audit` — handles single agent crash, batch failures, validator crash, report generator crash, session loss, Context7 unavailability
- **Code Audit Workflow** documented in plugin README — step-by-step guide for vibecoded project takeover with selective auditing examples
- **3 implementation modes**: economy (sonnet everywhere), quality (sonnet scanning + opus critical), premium (opus everywhere) — replaces 2-mode system across all commands
- **Brainstorming-style discovery** in `/bee:discuss` and `/bee:new-spec` — adaptive questioning with no fixed round limit, one question per message, multiple choice preferred, decomposition check for multi-subsystem features, 2-3 approaches with trade-offs
- **Spec review loop** in `/bee:new-spec` (Step 9.5) — spawns `spec-reviewer` agent after spec-writer, auto-fixes issues, max 5 iterations
- **Auto-fix review loop** in `/bee:plan-phase` (Step 6.4) and `/bee:plan-review` — fixes findings automatically, re-runs 4 agents to verify, configurable max iterations
- **`spec-reviewer` agent** — validates spec completeness, consistency, clarity, YAGNI, scope, architecture
- **`/bee:test-e2e` command** — generate and run Playwright E2E tests with Page Object Model, fixtures, and auto-fix loop
- **Push notifications** — `/bee:init` offers cross-platform notification setup (macOS osascript, Linux notify-send, Windows PowerShell toast) for Stop, Notification, and PermissionRequest events
- **`notify.sh` script** — cross-platform native notification with safe argument passing (no shell injection)
- **Init stack skill validation** (Step 2.5) — warns when detected stack has no matching skill, suggests `/bee:create-skill`
- **Init multi-stack completion summary** — shows all stacks with path and skill status (✓ / ⚠)
- **4 new stack skills**: `vue` (4,146w), `kmp-compose` (2,227w), `angular` (2,416w), `nestjs-rabbitmq` library skill (2,569w)
- **`frontend-standards` skill** enriched with design quality section (typography, color, motion, anti-AI-aesthetics), 250-line component limit, no business logic in visual components, Core Web Vitals
- **`shadcn-ui` library skill** (1,868w) — component patterns, theming, cn() utility, composition, auto-detected when `components.json` exists
- **`playwright` testing skill** (1,624w) — POM, fixtures, selectors, assertions, auth, network mocking
- **TDD discipline enforcement** in core SKILL.md — Iron Law, Watch It Fail, rationalizations table (9 items), red flags list (7 items), anti-patterns (5 items), verification checklist (8 items)
- **Systematic debugging** in `fixer.md` — root cause investigation step (3.5), enhanced test failure protocol with defense-in-depth thinking, architectural escalation after 2 failed attempts
- **Architectural clarity** in `implementer.md` and `quick-implementer.md` — defense-in-depth layers (1-4), condition-based waiting for async, enhanced RED/GREEN/REFACTOR phases
- **CLAUDE.md wiring** in review context packets — all review agents now read project-level CLAUDE.md for overrides
- Auto-detection rules for `vue`, `angular`, `kmp-compose` stacks in init
- `frontend-standards` reference in all 7 frontend stack skills
- Library skill detection chain: stack skill → frontend-standards → shadcn-ui (if installed)

### Changed
- Plugin README updated: 26 commands (from 24), 33 agents (from 22), 24 SubagentStop validators (from 13)
- Core skill updated with Context7 integration section
- **Stack skills extended**: react (2.1k→3.3k), nextjs (2.6k→3.6k), nestjs (2.2k→4.3k), laravel-inertia-react (2.6k→5.2k) — React 19 hooks, Server Actions, state management detection, forms+validation
- **State management** in all stack skills follows "detect what's installed" pattern (Redux, Zustand, TanStack Query, Pinia, NgRx, etc.)
- **Per-stack linter/testRunner** — `linter` and `testRunner` moved from root config into each stack entry (backward compatible with fallback chain). `ci` stays global. Detection, init, scripts, commands, and agents all updated.
- **All hook matchers anchored** with `^name$` — prevents extension agent name collisions
- **Researcher hook** supports dual-mode (phase research + spec/quick research) without false rejection
- **Escalation** uses `finding-validator` with `## Classification` format (not specialist agents) — prevents SubagentStop hook conflicts
- **Review loop** uses separate `$LOOP_ITERATION` counter from cumulative `iteration_counter` — prevents premature exit
- **Finding-validator** respects implementation_mode (economy → sonnet, quality/premium → opus)
- **Execute-phase, review.md, commit.md** use Glob for phase directory lookup (not slug construction)
- **Plan-review** options changed from Approve/Re-review/Modify to Fix(recommended)/Accept-as-is/Fix-manually
- **SubagentStop hook** for plan-compliance-reviewer allows requirements.md checkbox updates
- **SubagentStop hooks** strengthened for implementer and quick-implementer: verify red-green cycle (tests fail before impl, pass after)
- **Discuss-partner hook** uses `Scan complete:` signal for mode detection (not heading presence)
- `inject-memory.sh` strips `bee:` prefix from agent types, removed dead agents (`reviewer`, `project-reviewer`)
- `auto-lint.sh` removed `set -euo pipefail` (prevents hook crash), biome uses `check --write` (format + lint)
- `stop-review-check.sh` awk column comment corrected
- `new-spec.md` amend flow routes through spec review loop
- Config template: removed stale `quick.agents` key (only `quick.fast` remains)
