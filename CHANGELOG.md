## [4.0.0] - 2026-04-09 -- Bee Sentinel: Debug & Recovery Intelligence + Skills Expansion + Command Quality Overhaul

### Added
- **Forensics command** (`/bee:forensics`) -- Read-only workflow diagnostics with 4-factor severity escalation (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), 5-step cross-phase dependency tracing, rollback path generation (1-3 paths, safest-to-aggressive ordering), and forensics-to-debug handoff
- **Debug enhancement** (`/bee:debug`) -- Dynamic 3-7 hypothesis range with 20% auto-pruning, persistent session directories (state.json + report.md), `--resume` flag for interrupted sessions, pattern library with 40% keyword overlap matching for cross-session learning
- **Health intelligence** (`/bee:health`) -- 13 checks (up from 9): added workflow health, code quality trends, productivity metrics, forensic cross-reference. Historical baselining in health-history.json with per-check mode after 5 entries. 3+ consecutive degradation trend detection.
- **Error recovery** in `/bee:execute-phase` -- Failure classification (transient/persistent/architectural), cascading failure detection for Wave 2+ tasks, adaptive retry budgets (unlimited+backoff for transient, 3-attempt for persistent, 1+escalate for architectural), `$RECLASSIFIED_PERSISTENT` flag prevents classification loops
- **Cross-system bridges** -- Forensics-to-debug handoff with pre-populated symptoms, debug pattern library extraction on resolution, forensic cross-reference in health checks
- **Bee Mastery Guide** (`skills/guide/SKILL.md`) -- 205-line workflow intelligence skill with 6 sections: decision tree (spec + phase + multi-phase), command reference by intent (49 commands in 9 groups), smart feature suggestions (IF-THEN proactive rules), 13 anti-patterns, ecosystem model, self-referencing triggers. Dual delivery: compact excerpt at SessionStart + full guide on-demand.
- **Honeycomb statusline** -- New design with `bee` emoji, `hex` hexagons for phase progress, heavy-line context gauge, thin dotted separators
- **Scoped testing for parallel agents** -- Agents run ONLY their task-specific tests; conductor validates full suite + linter + static analysis once per wave (~70% time reduction)
- **Verification evidence** in SubagentStop hooks -- Implementer and quick-implementer agents must include actual test runner output, not just count claims
- **Context isolation docs** in core skill -- Defines what each agent type receives vs must NOT receive, with exceptions for retries and cascading failures
- **23 new commands**: autonomous, backlog, complete-spec, debug, forensics, health, insert-phase, next, note, pause, plan-all, profile, seed, ship, swarm-review, test-gen, thread, ui-review, ui-spec, workspace, audit-spec, do, help
- **7 new agents**: debug-investigator, dependency-auditor, assumptions-analyzer, integration-checker, swarm-consolidator, ui-auditor, testing-auditor
- **Post-wave full validation** (Step 5d.0 in execute-phase) -- Runs full test suite, linter, and static analysis ONCE per wave after all agents complete
- **Model escalation** in execute-phase -- Sonnet agents escalated to opus after 3 failures
- **18 new conditional library/standards skills** -- prisma, drizzle, tailwind-v4, tanstack-query, supabase, stripe, zustand, trpc, shadcn-vue, sentry, storybook, email, s3-storage, auth-patterns, realtime, ci-cd, docker, monorepo, i18n. All load conditionally based on package.json/config detection.
- **Firm rules R8 + R9** -- R8: no completion claims without evidence (paste actual test output). R9: HIGH confidence only for review findings (exact file:line, traceable impact, 5-15 per phase).
- **Async testing patterns** in standards/testing -- promises, timers, waitFor, error rejection, PHP queue fakes, flaky test prevention
- **Severity calibration table** in audit skill -- 7 borderline examples with "3 AM test" heuristic
- **Version-aware queries + result disambiguation** in context7 skill
- **Spec compliance procedure** in review skill -- list ACs by task ID, map to tests, trace code paths
- **Dark mode section** in frontend standards -- semantic tokens, Tailwind v3/v4 guidance

- 5 agent skill references fixed: `testing` -> `standards/testing` (implementer, quick-implementer, test-auditor, test-planner, laravel-inertia-vue/implementer)
- `inject-memory.sh` refactored to `is_bee_agent()` function with suffix matching for stack-specific agents (`*-implementer`, `*-bug-detector`, `*-pattern-reviewer`, `*-stack-reviewer`)
- SubagentStop matchers use negative lookbehind to prevent double-match: `(?<!quick-)implementer$`, `(?<!audit-)bug-detector$`

- `autonomous.md` handles REVIEWING status, passes max_review_iterations from config, documents LEARNINGS.md as resume-only
- `ship.md` reads success criteria from ROADMAP.md (was phases.md)
- `seed.md` counts only active seeds toward 20 limit (was counting all including archived)

## [3.1.0] - 2026-03-17 -- Audit System & Quality Expansion

### Added
- **Comprehensive code audit system** — `/bee:audit` command orchestrates 9 specialized audit agents in parallel, validates findings to filter hallucinations, and generates a structured report
- **Audit-to-spec bridge** — `/bee:audit-to-spec` converts confirmed audit findings into actionable specs grouped by severity (CRITICAL → individual specs, HIGH → grouped, MEDIUM → cleanup, LOW → consolidated)
- **9 specialized audit agents**: security-auditor (SEC), error-handling-auditor (ERR), database-auditor (DB), architecture-auditor (ARCH), api-auditor (API), frontend-auditor (FE), performance-auditor (PERF), testing-auditor (TEST), audit-bug-detector (BUG)
- **Finding validator** — audit-finding-validator reads actual code to classify findings as CONFIRMED / FALSE POSITIVE / NEEDS CONTEXT, eliminating hallucinations
- **Report generator** — audit-report-generator merges validated findings into `AUDIT-REPORT.md` (human-readable) and `audit-findings.json` (machine-readable for audit-to-spec)
- **Audit skill** — `skills/audit/SKILL.md` defines severity levels, finding format with agent prefixes, validation rules, report template, and spec generation rules
- **11 SubagentStop validators** for all audit agents — enforce finding format, read-only compliance, and summary section presence
- **Context7 integration docs** in `core/SKILL.md` — centralized how-to, when-to-use, fallback behavior, multi-stack usage
- **Comprehensive error recovery** in `/bee:audit` — handles single agent crash, batch failures, validator crash, report generator crash, session loss, Context7 unavailability
- **Code Audit Workflow** documented in plugin README — step-by-step guide for vibecoded project takeover with selective auditing examples
- **3 implementation modes**: economy (sonnet everywhere), quality (sonnet scanning + opus critical), premium (opus everywhere) — replaces 2-mode system across all commands
- **Brainstorming-style discovery** in `/bee:discuss` and `/bee:new-spec` — adaptive questioning with no fixed round limit, one question per message, multiple choice preferred, decomposition check for multi-subsystem features, 2-3 approaches with trade-offs
- **Spec review loop** in `/bee:new-spec` (Step 9.5) — spawns `spec-reviewer` agent after spec-writer, auto-fixes issues, max 5 iterations
- **Auto-fix review loop** in `/bee:plan-phase` (Step 6.4) and `/bee:plan-review` — fixes findings automatically, re-runs 4 agents to verify, configurable max iterations
- **`spec-reviewer` agent** — validates spec completeness, consistency, clarity, YAGNI, scope, architecture
- **`/bee:test-e2e` command** — generate and run Playwright E2E tests with Page Object Model, fixtures, and auto-fix loop
- **Push notifications** — `/bee:init` offers cross-platform notification setup (macOS osascript, Linux notify-send, Windows PowerShell toast) for Stop, Notification, and PermissionRequest events
- **`notify.sh` script** — cross-platform native notification with safe argument passing (no shell injection)
- **Init stack skill validation** (Step 2.5) — warns when detected stack has no matching skill, suggests `/bee:create-skill`
- **Init multi-stack completion summary** — shows all stacks with path and skill status (✓ / ⚠)
- **4 new stack skills**: `vue` (4,146w), `kmp-compose` (2,227w), `angular` (2,416w), `nestjs-rabbitmq` library skill (2,569w)
- **`frontend-standards` skill** enriched with design quality section (typography, color, motion, anti-AI-aesthetics), 250-line component limit, no business logic in visual components, Core Web Vitals
- **`shadcn-ui` library skill** (1,868w) — component patterns, theming, cn() utility, composition, auto-detected when `components.json` exists
- **`playwright` testing skill** (1,624w) — POM, fixtures, selectors, assertions, auth, network mocking
- **TDD discipline enforcement** in core SKILL.md — Iron Law, Watch It Fail, rationalizations table (9 items), red flags list (7 items), anti-patterns (5 items), verification checklist (8 items)
- **Systematic debugging** in `fixer.md` — root cause investigation step (3.5), enhanced test failure protocol with defense-in-depth thinking, architectural escalation after 2 failed attempts
- **Architectural clarity** in `implementer.md` and `quick-implementer.md` — defense-in-depth layers (1-4), condition-based waiting for async, enhanced RED/GREEN/REFACTOR phases
- **CLAUDE.md wiring** in review context packets — all review agents now read project-level CLAUDE.md for overrides
- Auto-detection rules for `vue`, `angular`, `kmp-compose` stacks in init
- `frontend-standards` reference in all 7 frontend stack skills
- Library skill detection chain: stack skill → frontend-standards → shadcn-ui (if installed)

### Changed
- Plugin README updated: 26 commands (from 24), 33 agents (from 22), 24 SubagentStop validators (from 13)
- Core skill updated with Context7 integration section
- **Stack skills extended**: react (2.1k→3.3k), nextjs (2.6k→3.6k), nestjs (2.2k→4.3k), laravel-inertia-react (2.6k→5.2k) — React 19 hooks, Server Actions, state management detection, forms+validation
- **State management** in all stack skills follows "detect what's installed" pattern (Redux, Zustand, TanStack Query, Pinia, NgRx, etc.)
- **Per-stack linter/testRunner** — `linter` and `testRunner` moved from root config into each stack entry (backward compatible with fallback chain). `ci` stays global. Detection, init, scripts, commands, and agents all updated.
- **All hook matchers anchored** with `^name$` — prevents extension agent name collisions
- **Researcher hook** supports dual-mode (phase research + spec/quick research) without false rejection
- **Escalation** uses `finding-validator` with `## Classification` format (not specialist agents) — prevents SubagentStop hook conflicts
- **Review loop** uses separate `$LOOP_ITERATION` counter from cumulative `iteration_counter` — prevents premature exit
- **Finding-validator** respects implementation_mode (economy → sonnet, quality/premium → opus)
- **Execute-phase, review.md, commit.md** use Glob for phase directory lookup (not slug construction)
- **Plan-review** options changed from Approve/Re-review/Modify to Fix(recommended)/Accept-as-is/Fix-manually
- **SubagentStop hook** for plan-compliance-reviewer allows requirements.md checkbox updates
- **SubagentStop hooks** strengthened for implementer and quick-implementer: verify red-green cycle (tests fail before impl, pass after)
- **Discuss-partner hook** uses `Scan complete:` signal for mode detection (not heading presence)
- `inject-memory.sh` strips `bee:` prefix from agent types, removed dead agents (`reviewer`, `project-reviewer`)
- `auto-lint.sh` removed `set -euo pipefail` (prevents hook crash), biome uses `check --write` (format + lint)
- `stop-review-check.sh` awk column comment corrected
- `new-spec.md` amend flow routes through spec review loop
- Config template: removed stale `quick.agents` key (only `quick.fast` remains)
- Init migration summary no longer falsely claims adding `quick.agents`
