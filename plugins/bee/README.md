# Bee - Spec-Driven Development Workflow

A Claude Code plugin that enforces disciplined, spec-driven development with TDD, parallel agent execution, persistent agent memory, review gates, and autonomous autopilot mode.

## What Bee Does

Bee structures your development workflow into a lifecycle: **Spec > Plan > Execute > Review > Test > Commit**. Each step produces artifacts on disk, every feature goes through review gates, and 13 specialized agents handle different aspects of the work.

## Workflows

### Full Feature Workflow (Spec to Done)

The complete lifecycle for building a feature with full quality gates:

```
1. /bee:init                    # One-time project setup
2. /bee:new-spec                # Describe the feature, answer questions, get spec.md + phases.md
3. /bee:plan-phase 1            # Decompose phase 1 into tasks with acceptance criteria
   /bee:plan-review 1           # (Optional) Verify plan covers all spec requirements
4. /bee:execute-phase 1         # TDD implementation -- agents work in parallel waves
5. /bee:review                  # Code review against spec + standards, auto-fix findings
6. /bee:test                    # Generate manual test scenarios, verify with developer
7. /bee:commit                  # Review diff, approve commit message
   --- repeat steps 3-7 for each phase ---
8. /bee:review-project          # Final compliance check: does implementation match spec?
9. /bee:eod                     # End-of-day health check (integrity, tests, compliance)
```

**What happens at each step:**

| Step | Input | Output | Agents Used |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| `new-spec` | Feature description + Q&A | `spec.md`, `phases.md`, `requirements.md` | spec-shaper, spec-writer |
| `plan-phase` | `spec.md` + phase number | `TASKS.md` with waves | phase-planner, researcher |
| `execute-phase` | `TASKS.md` | Implementation + tests | implementer (parallel per wave) |
| `review` | Implementation files | `REVIEW.md` with findings | reviewer, finding-validator, fixer |
| `test` | Implementation + spec | `TESTING.md` with scenarios | test-planner |
| `commit` | Git diff | Git commit | (none -- main context) |
| `review-project` | All phases + spec | `REVIEW-PROJECT.md` | project-reviewer |
| `eod` | Full project state | Integrity + health report | integrity-auditor, test-auditor, project-reviewer, reviewer |

### Autopilot Workflow (Hands-Off)

Run all phases from a spec automatically with no human gates:

```
1. /bee:new-spec                # Create the spec first
2. /bee:autopilot               # Runs a script that executes ALL phases
3. git diff                     # Review your changes
4. /bee:commit                  # Commit when satisfied
```

**How autopilot works:**

Each step (plan, execute, review) runs as a **separate `claude -p` session** with a fresh context window. A bash script orchestrates the loop. STATE.md on disk coordinates between steps.

```
Per phase: Plan (3-pass) -> Execute (parallel waves) -> Review + Auto-fix
After all: Project Review
```

- Fresh context per step -- no bloat, no compacting needed
- No commits (you review the diff after)
- No manual testing (TDD during execution provides coverage)
- All gates auto-approved (plans, review findings, stylistic fixes)
- Ctrl+C safe: re-run `/bee:autopilot` to resume from STATE.md

### Quick Task Workflow (No Spec)

For small tasks that don't need the full spec pipeline:

```
1. /bee:quick fix the login button alignment on mobile
   # Bee executes the task directly with TDD, no spec needed

2. /bee:quick --agents add dark mode toggle to the settings page
   # Same but spawns researcher + implementer agents for more complex work

3. /bee:quick --review refactor the auth middleware to use JWT
   # Executes + runs a quick review before presenting for commit
```

**Quick workflow flow:**

```
Describe task --> Execute (TDD) --> [Optional: Review] --> Approve --> Commit
```

### Quick Review Workflow (No Spec)

For reviewing changes you've made outside of Bee:

```
# Make changes manually or with regular Claude Code...
# Then review what you've done:

/bee:quick-review              # Reviews uncommitted changes against standards
                                # No spec required -- works on any git changes
```

### Multi-Phase Parallel Workflow

When phases have no dependencies between them:

```
/bee:plan-phase 2
/bee:plan-phase 3
/bee:parallel-phases 2 3        # Both phases execute simultaneously with agent teams
/bee:review                     # Review each completed phase
```

### Resume After Break

```
/bee:resume                     # Restores full context from STATE.md + SESSION-CONTEXT.md
/bee:progress                   # Shows where you left off and suggests next action
```

## Agent Memory System

Agents accumulate per-project learnings in `.bee/memory/`:

- `shared.md` -- cross-cutting project knowledge all agents read
- `{agent-name}.md` -- per-agent knowledge (patterns, gotchas, conventions)

Memory is automatically injected via the `SubagentStart` hook. Write-capable agents append learnings after each task. The main context stays lean -- memory is only loaded by subagents.

## Hooks

| Event | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **SessionStart** | Load project context (STATE.md, config) + configure statusline |
| **PostToolUse** | Auto-lint modified files after Write/Edit |
| **PreCompact** | Snapshot session context before compaction |
| **SubagentStart** | Inject agent memory into subagent context |
| **SubagentStop** | Validate agent output (TDD compliance, format, completeness) |
| **Stop** | Check for unreviewed executed phases |
| **SessionEnd** | Warn about memory files approaching limits |

## Configuration

Bee stores configuration in `.bee/config.json`:

```json
{
  "stack": "laravel-inertia-vue",
  "linter": "pint",
  "testRunner": "pest",
  "context7": true,
  "review": { "against_spec": true, "against_standards": true },
  "phases": { "require_review_before_next": true }
}
```
