# Bee - Spec-Driven Development Workflow

A Claude Code plugin that enforces disciplined, spec-driven development with TDD, parallel agent execution, persistent agent memory, and review gates.

## What Bee Does

Bee structures your development workflow into a lifecycle: **Spec > Plan > Execute > Review > Test > Commit**. Each step produces artifacts on disk, every feature goes through review gates, and 22 specialized agents handle different aspects of the work.

## Workflows

### Full Feature Workflow (Spec to Done)

The complete lifecycle for building a feature with full quality gates:

```
1. /bee:init                    # One-time project setup
2. /bee:new-spec                # Describe the feature, answer questions, get spec.md + phases.md
3. /bee:plan-phase 1            # Decompose phase 1 into tasks with acceptance criteria
                                # Plan review runs automatically (4 parallel agents) -- developer approves or modifies
   /bee:plan-review 1           # Standalone plan review still available if needed separately
4. /bee:execute-phase 1         # TDD implementation -- agents work in parallel waves
5. /bee:review                  # Code review against spec + standards, auto-fix findings
6. /bee:test                    # Generate manual test scenarios, verify with developer
7. /bee:commit                  # Review diff, approve commit message
   --- repeat steps 3-7 for each phase ---
8. /bee:review-implementation   # Final compliance check: does implementation match spec?
9. /bee:archive-spec            # Archive completed spec, reset STATE.md
10. /bee:eod                    # End-of-day health check (integrity, tests, compliance)
```

**What happens at each step:**

| Step | Input | Output | Agents Used |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| `new-spec` | Feature description + structured interview (2-5 adaptive rounds) | `spec.md`, `phases.md`, `requirements.md` | spec-shaper, spec-writer |
| `plan-phase` | `spec.md` + phase number | `TASKS.md` with waves | phase-planner, researcher, plan-reviewer (automatic review step) |
| `execute-phase` | `TASKS.md` | Implementation + tests | implementer (parallel per wave) |
| `review` | Implementation files | `REVIEW.md` with findings | bug-detector, pattern-reviewer, plan-compliance-reviewer, stack-reviewer, finding-validator, fixer |
| `test` | Implementation + spec | `TESTING.md` with scenarios | test-planner |
| `commit` | Git diff | Git commit | (none -- main context) |
| `review-implementation` | All phases + spec (or ad-hoc changes) | `REVIEW-IMPLEMENTATION.md` | bug-detector, pattern-reviewer, plan-compliance-reviewer, stack-reviewer, finding-validator, fixer |
| `archive-spec` | Completed spec | Archived spec, reset STATE.md | (none -- main context) |
| `eod` | Full project state | Integrity + health report | integrity-auditor, test-auditor, plan-compliance-reviewer, pattern-reviewer |

### Quick Task Workflow (No Spec)

For small tasks that don't need the full spec pipeline. Quick tasks are tracked in a separate STATE.md section with no impact on the spec/phase pipeline.

```
1. /bee:quick fix the login button alignment on mobile
   # Agents mode (default) -- spawns researcher + implementer agents

2. /bee:quick --fast fix the button color
   # Direct mode -- executes inline without agents

3. /bee:quick --amend 3
   # Modify existing quick task plan #3

4. /bee:quick --review refactor the auth middleware to use JWT
   # Executes + runs a quick review before presenting for commit
```

**Quick workflow flow:**

```
Describe task --> Execute (TDD) --> [Optional: Review] --> Approve --> Commit
```

### Ad-hoc Review (No Spec)

For reviewing changes you've made outside of Bee:

```
# Make changes manually or with regular Claude Code...
# Then review what you've done:

/bee:review-implementation      # Auto-detects ad-hoc mode (3 agents, no spec required)
                                # Works on any uncommitted git changes
```

### Resume After Break

```
/bee:resume                     # Restores full context from STATE.md + SESSION-CONTEXT.md
/bee:progress                   # Shows where you left off and suggests next action
```

## Agent Memory System

Agents accumulate per-project learnings in `.bee/memory/`:

- `shared.md` -- cross-cutting project knowledge all agents read
- `{agent-name}.md` -- per-agent knowledge (patterns, gotchas, conventions)

Memory is automatically injected via the `SubagentStart` hook. Write-capable agents append learnings after each task. The main context stays lean -- memory is only loaded by subagents.

## Hooks

| Event | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **SessionStart** | Load project context (STATE.md, config) + configure statusline |
| **PostToolUse** | Auto-lint modified files after Write/Edit |
| **PreToolUse** | Pre-commit validation gate -- runs linter + test checks before allowing commits |
| **PreCompact** | Snapshot session context before compaction |
| **SubagentStart** | Inject agent memory into subagent context |
| **SubagentStop** | Validate agent output (TDD compliance, format, completeness) -- includes role-specific validation for 4 specialized review agents |
| **Stop** | Check for unreviewed executed phases |
| **SessionEnd** | Warn about memory files approaching limits |

## Configuration

Bee stores configuration in `.bee/config.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "stacks": [
    { "name": "laravel-inertia-vue", "path": "." }
  ],
  "implementation_mode": "quality",
  "linter": "pint",
  "testRunner": "pest",
  "ci": "github-actions",
  "context7": true,
  "review": {
