[bee] Task completion blocked: missing `## Task Notes` section.

bee Agent Team teammates must emit a `## Task Notes` section before marking
a task complete. The conductor and SubagentStop hook chain consume this
section to update TASKS.md `notes:` fields.

Required shape (one line, no narrative paragraphs):
  T{ID} {OK|FAILED|BLOCKED} | files: a,b | tests: N/M | blocker: <reason|none>

Append a `## Task Notes` section to your final message and try again.
