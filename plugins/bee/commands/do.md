description: Route natural language intent to the right bee command
argument-hint: "[describe what you want to do]"
---

## Current State (load before proceeding)

Read these files using the Read tool:
- `.bee/STATE.md` -- if not found: NOT_INITIALIZED
- `.bee/config.json` -- if not found: use `{}`

## Instructions

You are running `/bee:do` -- an intent router that translates natural language into the right bee command. Follow these steps in order.

### Not Initialized

If `.bee/STATE.md` does not exist (NOT_INITIALIZED), tell the user:
"BeeDev is not initialized. Run `/bee:init` first."
Do NOT proceed.

### Step 1: Parse Input

Read `$ARGUMENTS` as a natural language description. If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask the user:

```
AskUserQuestion(
  question: "What do you want to do?",
  options: ["Fix a bug", "Plan a feature", "Review code", "Check status", "Custom"]
)
```

Use the user's response as the intent text.

### Step 2: Classify Intent

Match the intent text against these keyword patterns. Use the FIRST match found:

| compact, compress, save context, slim down | `/bee:compact` | Smart context-preserving compact |
| init, initialize, setup, start fresh | `/bee:init` | Initialize BeeDev |
| update bee, upgrade bee | `/bee:update` | Update Bee plugin |

If no keywords match, display:
"Could not determine intent. Try `/bee:help` for available commands."
Stop here.

### Step 3: Suggest Command

Present the suggestion to the user:

```
AskUserQuestion(
  question: "Intent: {user's description}\nSuggested: /bee:{matched command}",
  options: ["Run /bee:{command}", "Show alternatives", "Custom"]
)
```

### Step 4: Handle Choice

- **Run /bee:{command}**: Invoke the command using `Skill(skill: "bee:{command}")`. If the Skill tool is unavailable, display "Run `/bee:{command}` now." as a fallback.
- **Show alternatives**: Display 3-5 related commands with one-line descriptions from the classification table above. Then present:

```
AskUserQuestion(
  question: "Pick an alternative:",
  options: ["/bee:{alt1}", "/bee:{alt2}", "/bee:{alt3}", "Custom"]
)
```

For the selected alternative, display "Run `/bee:{command}` now." Do NOT auto-invoke.

- **Custom**: Wait for free-text input from the user.

**Design Notes (do not display to user):**

- /bee:do NEVER executes commands itself -- it only suggests. This keeps the user in control and avoids recursive command invocation issues.
- Intent classification uses simple keyword matching, not LLM reasoning. First match wins.
- The alternatives shown for "Show alternatives" should be contextually related commands (e.g., if matched `/bee:review`, show `/bee:audit`, `/bee:test`, `/bee:review-implementation`).
- No agents needed. No Task tool. Pure command logic with Read and AskUserQuestion.
- For workflow intelligence beyond keyword matching, the Bee Mastery Guide (`skills/guide/SKILL.md`) provides decision trees, intent routing, and proactive feature suggestions.
