description: Resume BeeDev work from where you left off with full context restoration
argument-hint: ""
---

## Current State (load before proceeding)

Read these files using the Read tool:
- `.bee/STATE.md` — if not found: NOT_INITIALIZED
- `.bee/config.json` — if not found: use `{}`
- `.bee/user.md` — if not found: NO_USER_PREFS (skip silently)
- `.bee/COMPACT-CONTEXT.md` — if not found: try `.bee/SESSION-CONTEXT.md` — if neither found: NO_SESSION_CONTEXT
- `.bee/CONTEXT.md` — if not found: NO_CONTEXT
- `.bee/pause-handoff.md` — if not found: NO_PAUSE_HANDOFF

## Instructions

You are running `/bee:resume` -- a context restoration command for developers returning to work after a break. Read the injected state above and provide a full briefing so the developer can pick up exactly where they left off.

### Not Initialized

If the state above contains `NOT_INITIALIZED`, respond:

"BeeDev is not initialized for this project. Run `/bee:init` to get started."

Stop here -- do not proceed with the rest of the instructions.

### Step 0: Pause Detection

If `NO_PAUSE_HANDOFF` does NOT appear in the injected context (meaning `.bee/pause-handoff.md` was found):

**Corruption check:** If the handoff file is empty or does not contain a `## Current Position` section, treat it as corrupt: display "Found a pause handoff but it appears incomplete. Deleting it." then delete the file (`rm .bee/pause-handoff.md`) and skip to the Context Restoration Briefing below.

**Staleness check:** Compare the spec name from the handoff's "## Current Position" section against STATE.md's current spec name. If they differ, display a warning: "This handoff is from a different spec ({handoff spec}). Current spec is {current spec}. The handoff context may be outdated." and add "Delete stale handoff" as an extra option in the menu below.

Display the pause context prominently:

```
--- You paused here ---

Position: {spec name} > Phase {N} ({phase status})
Paused: {paused_at from frontmatter} | Branch: {branch} | Uncommitted: {uncommitted}

Completed:
{bulleted list of items from "## Completed Work" section}

Remaining:
{bulleted list of items from "## Remaining Work" section}

{If "## Blockers" is not "None":}
Blockers:
{bulleted list of blockers}

{If "## Decisions Made" is not "None recorded this session":}
Decisions:
{bulleted list of decisions}

Next action: {command from "## Next Action"} -- {reason}

--- End pause context ---
```

Then present the pause resume menu:

```
AskUserQuestion(
  question: "You paused here. Ready to continue?",
  options: ["Continue (delete handoff)", "Show full briefing", "Custom"]
)
```

Handle choices:

- **Continue (delete handoff)**: First, extract the "Next Action" suggestion from the handoff content already loaded in context above. Then delete the handoff file using Bash: `rm .bee/pause-handoff.md`. Proceed to the "Context Restoration Briefing" section below. In the briefing's "What To Do Next" section (section 5), add a "Pause recommendation" banner showing the extracted next command so the user sees it in context.
- **Show full briefing**: Leave `.bee/pause-handoff.md` on disk for reference. Proceed to the "Context Restoration Briefing" section below.
- **Custom**: Wait for free-text input from the user and act on it.

Both "Continue" and "Show full briefing" fall through to the full 7-section Context Restoration Briefing below.

If `NO_PAUSE_HANDOFF` appears: skip this step entirely and proceed to the briefing below.

### Context Restoration Briefing

Think of yourself as an assistant who remembers everything about the project. Provide a structured briefing:

**1. Where You Left Off**

Read the Last Action section from STATE.md:
- What command was last run
- When it was run (timestamp)
- What was its result

Present this as a natural sentence: "Last time, you ran `/bee:{command}` on {date} and {result}."

**Metrics Summary (if available):**

Check if config.json has `metrics.enabled` set to `true` (default true if absent). If disabled, skip this subsection.

Use Glob to find `.bee/metrics/{spec-folder-name}/phase-*.json` files (where spec-folder-name is extracted from STATE.md Current Spec Path). If any exist:
- Count completed phases (those with non-null `execution.completed_at`)
- If the active phase has a metrics file, show: "Phase {N}: {exec_duration formatted} exec, {review_duration formatted} review ({iterations} rounds)"
- If session metrics exist (`.bee/metrics/sessions/session-*.json`), find the most recent and show: "Last session: {duration formatted as Xh Ym}"
- If 3+ phases have metrics, show health line: "Avg phase: {avg_duration formatted}, review efficiency: {100 - avg_fp_rate}%"

If no metrics files exist: skip this subsection entirely (no "No metrics" message -- just omit).

**Health Baseline and Trends (if available):**

Read `.bee/metrics/health-history.json` if it exists. If it does not exist or is empty, skip this subsection entirely.

If health-history.json exists and contains entries:

1. Display baseline status if 5+ entries exist:
   - Count total entries.
   - Determine overall baseline: compute the per-check baseline for each of the 13 check dimensions (mode of each check's status across all entries, prefer better on tie: PASS > WARN > FAIL). Then derive overall baseline: all check baselines PASS = HEALTHY, any FAIL = UNHEALTHY, else WARNINGS. This matches health.md's authoritative per-check approach.
   - Find baseline start date: starting from the most recent entry, count backward through consecutive entries that match the current overall baseline status. The baseline start date is the timestamp of the first (oldest) entry in that consecutive trailing run.
   - Display: `Health baseline: {HEALTHY|WARNINGS|UNHEALTHY} since {formatted date} ({N} sessions)`
   - If fewer than 5 entries: `Health baseline: Establishing ({N}/5 sessions)`

2. Check for degradation trends:
   - Take the last 5 entries (or all if fewer than 5).
   - For each of the 13 check dimensions (state_md, config_json, spec_path, phase_dirs, hung_phases, tasks_md, git, metrics, seeds, workflow_health, code_quality, productivity, forensic_xref):
     - Compute the baseline for that check (mode across all entries, prefer better status on tie: PASS > WARN > FAIL). If fewer than 5 entries exist, use PASS as the assumed baseline for each check (matching health.md's trend detection behavior).
     - Check if the check has been at a WORSE status than its baseline for 3+ consecutive entries (counting from newest backward). Worse means: baseline is PASS but recent entries are WARN or FAIL; or baseline is WARN but recent entries are FAIL.
   - If any degradation trends found, display:
     ```
     Health alerts:
       {warning icon} {check_name} degrading: {from_status} -> {to_status} for {N} sessions
     ```
   - If no trends: omit the Health alerts section (no "no alerts" message).

3. If the overall_status of the most recent entry is UNHEALTHY, add: `Run /bee:health for full diagnostics and recovery suggestions.`

**Learnings Summary (if available):**

Check if config.json has `adaptive.learning` set to `true` (default true if absent). If disabled, skip.

Use Glob to find `{spec-path}/phases/*/LEARNINGS.md`. If any active learnings exist (expiry >= current phase):
- Show: "Active learnings: {count} phase(s) feeding adjustment instructions to implementers"
- If a predictive warning pattern exists (same top category across 2+ recent phases): "Predictive warning active: '{category}' pattern"

If no learnings: skip silently (no "No learnings" message).

**2. Current Position**

Summarize the project state:
- **Spec:** Name and status (or "No spec defined yet")
- **Stack:** From config.json
- **Active phase:** Which phase is currently in progress (if any)
- **Phase status:** What stage the active phase is in (planned / executing / executed / reviewing / reviewed / testing / tested / ready to commit)

If there are multiple phases, show which ones are complete and which remain.

**3. Session Context (if available)**

If `NO_SESSION_CONTEXT` does NOT appear in the injected context (meaning `.bee/COMPACT-CONTEXT.md` or `.bee/SESSION-CONTEXT.md` was found), this contains a snapshot of the working state from the last session. Present:
- What was actively being worked on
- Any pending decisions or choices the developer needs to make
- Wave progress (if mid-execution): which tasks are complete, which remain
- Any warnings or blockers noted in the session context

If `NO_SESSION_CONTEXT` appears, note: "No session context saved from last time." and skip this section.

**4. Phase Details (if mid-execution)**

If a phase is currently being executed (status shows partial completion), provide details:
- How many tasks/waves are complete vs remaining
- Which specific task or wave is next
- Any notes about what was in progress

Read this from the Phases table and any additional state information.

**4.5. Workspace Status**

Read `$PROJECT_ROOT/.bee/workspaces.json`. If the file exists and contains workspaces with `"status": "active"`:

Include in the briefing:
- Active workspace count: "Active workspaces: {N}"
- For each active workspace, show: `{name} ({branch}) - {status_detail}`
- If any workspace has non-empty `conflicts_with` entries with severity "conflict": "Warning: workspace conflicts detected. Run `/bee:workspace dashboard`."
- If any workspace has non-empty `depends_on` arrays: "{N} workspace dependencies declared."

If `$PROJECT_ROOT/.bee/workspaces.json` does not exist or contains no active workspaces: omit this section entirely.

**4.6. Matching Seeds**

If `.bee/seeds/` directory exists, check for active seeds:
1. Use Glob to find `.bee/seeds/seed-*.md` files. Read each frontmatter and count those with `status: active`.
2. If a spec is currently in progress (status is `IN_PROGRESS` or `SPEC_CREATED`):
   - Read the current spec description from the spec file
   - Count seeds whose `trigger` field might match the current spec context (quick LLM evaluation)
   - Display: "Seeds: {N} active ({M} potentially relevant to current spec)"
3. If no active spec:
   - Display: "Seeds: {N} active ideas in backlog"
4. If `.bee/seeds/` does not exist or no active seeds found, omit this section entirely.

**4.7. Sentinel Status**

Display Sentinel-specific status for context restoration. Each subsection only appears if data exists.

**Active Debug Sessions:**
Use Glob to find `.bee/debug/sessions/*/state.json` files. Read each and check for `"status": "active"`.
- If active sessions exist, display:
  ```
  Active debug sessions:
    - {slug}: {symptoms.description truncated to 60 chars} (since {created date})
  ```
  Add a note: "Resume with `/bee:debug --resume {slug}`"
- If no active sessions: omit.

**Recent Forensic Findings:**
Use Glob to find `.bee/forensics/*-report.md` files. Sort by filename descending (newest first). Take the most recent report (if any).
- Read the report and check the Severity Summary table for CRITICAL or HIGH counts > 0.
- If unresolved CRITICAL or HIGH findings exist, display:
  ```
  Recent forensics: {CRITICAL count} critical, {HIGH count} high finding(s) in latest report
    Report: {report file path}
  ```
- If no CRITICAL/HIGH or no reports: omit.

Before determining the next command, also check for uncommitted changes via Bash:
- `git diff --stat`
- `git status --short`
This is needed to correctly evaluate the "No spec but uncommitted changes" row in the next-action table.

**5. What To Do Next**

Suggest the specific next command based on state analysis. Use the same logic as `/bee:progress` but provide more context about *why* this is the right next step:

| Current State | Suggested Command | Context |
|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| No spec but uncommitted changes | `/bee:review-implementation` | "Uncommitted work exists. Review it before starting a new spec." |
| `NO_SPEC` (no uncommitted changes) | `/bee:new-spec` | "You haven't defined a spec yet. Start by describing what you want to build." |
| Spec exists, no phases planned | `/bee:plan-phase 1` | "Your spec '{name}' is ready. The next step is to break it into executable phases." |
| Next phase PENDING (not yet planned) | `/bee:plan-phase N` | "Phase N needs planning before execution." |
| Phase planned, not executed | `/bee:execute-phase N` | "Phase N ('{name}') has a plan ready. Execute it to generate the implementation." |
| Phase executed, not reviewed | `/bee:review` | "Phase N is implemented. Review it to catch issues before moving on." |
| Phase reviewed, not tested | `/bee:test` | "Review is complete. Generate test scenarios to verify the implementation." |
| Phase tested, not committed | `/bee:commit` | "Everything looks good. Commit this phase's work." |
| All phases done | `/bee:complete-spec` | "All phases complete. Run the spec completion ceremony (audit, changelog, tag, archive). For a quick archive, use `/bee:archive-spec` directly." |
| Status is ARCHIVED | `/bee:new-spec` | "Previous spec archived. Start a new one when ready." |

**6. Codebase Context**

If `NO_CONTEXT` does NOT appear in the injected context (meaning `.bee/CONTEXT.md` was found), present the content under the heading "Codebase Context (from .bee/CONTEXT.md)". This gives the developer a quick reminder of the project's architecture, key patterns, and conventions.

If `NO_CONTEXT` appears, note: "No codebase context extracted yet. Run `/bee:refresh-context` to extract it." and skip this section.

**7. Extensions**

Use the Glob tool to scan for local extensions:
- Glob for `.claude/bee-extensions/agents/*.md`
- Glob for `.claude/bee-extensions/skills/*.md`

If neither glob returns any files, display: "No local extensions."

If files are found, read each file and extract the frontmatter `name:` field. List them by that name:

- Under "Custom Agents:" list each agent found in `.claude/bee-extensions/agents/`
- Under "Custom Skills:" list each skill found in `.claude/bee-extensions/skills/`

Only show the heading that has results (e.g., if there are agents but no skills, only show "Custom Agents:").

After the list, add the note: "These extensions are available for use in this session."

After presenting all sections above, end with an interactive menu:

```
AskUserQuestion(
  question: "Context restored. [briefing summary]",
  options: ["[suggested next command]", "Custom"]
)
```

The `[briefing summary]` is a one-line recap (e.g. "Phase 2 is implemented and ready to review."). The first option is the suggested next command from section 5. "Custom" is always last.

### Output Format

The resume briefing should feel like a colleague catching you up after a break. Be thorough but structured -- use headers and short paragraphs, not walls of text. The developer should be able to read it in 30 seconds and know exactly where they are and what to do next.
